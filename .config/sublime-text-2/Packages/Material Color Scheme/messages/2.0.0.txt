Material 2.0:

When upgrading from 1.x, you will need to reactivate the Material scheme from your preferences menu.

Preferences -> Color Scheme...

As part of a refactor, the location of the *.tmTheme files changed.

Roadmap:

I do plan on making at least one other variant and also properly theming ST3. It is in the works.
